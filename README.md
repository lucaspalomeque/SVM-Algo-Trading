# Application of SVM & Random Forest on Algo Trading

This repository is about to deploy an quantitative trading algorithm based on the application of support vector machine and random forest.

The idea and design of experiment are based on this paper [Application of Support Vector Machine on Algorithmic Trading](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2136876869?pq-origsite=gscholar).
